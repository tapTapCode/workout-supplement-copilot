  - tip: "If you're booked 4+ weeks out consistently, your prices are too low. Raise them."
    category: "business_mentorship"

    category: "business_mentorship"
    
  - tip: "Client retention is cheaper than client acquisition. A rebooking client costs you $0 in marketing."
    category: "business_mentorship"

  - tip: "Building clientele takes 6-12 months. If you expect to be booked solid in month 2, you'll quit in month 3."

  - tip: "A follow-up text 2 days after their appointment is the easiest way to stand out. Most stylists don't do it."
    category: "business_mentorship"
