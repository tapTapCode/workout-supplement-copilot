# Introduction: Why Most Stylists Are Broke

Let me keep it real with you - most stylists are charging WAY too little. And I get it, I was there too. When I started, I was doing $50 installs that took me 6 hours. Do the math - that's embarrassing.

The problem isn't that clients won't pay more. The problem is nobody taught us how to price. Cosmetology school teaches you how to do hair, not how to run a business.

So let's fix that today.

# Module 1: The Pricing Formula

Here's the formula I wish someone had given me on day one:

**Service Price = Time + Products + Overhead + Profit**

Let me break each one down:

## Time Cost

First, figure out what your time is worth per hour.

1. What do you want to make per year? Let's say $60,000
2. Divide by 50 weeks (give yourself 2 weeks off): $1,200/week
3. Divide by hours you'll actually work (not 40 - be realistic): Let's say 30 hours
4. That's $40/hour MINIMUM

So if a service takes you 3 hours, that's $120 just for your time.

## Product Cost

Track what you actually use. Most stylists have no idea.

For a typical natural hair styling appointment:
- Shampoo: ~$2
- Conditioner: ~$3
- Leave-in: ~$2
- Styling products: ~$3
- Total: ~$10

## Overhead

This is where people mess up. You have costs even when you're not doing hair:

- Rent/booth fee
- Utilities
- Insurance
- Tools (amortized)
- Marketing
- Software/booking system
- Continuing education

Add up your monthly overhead, divide by number of services you do per month.

Example: $1,500 overhead ÷ 60 services = $25 per service

## Profit Margin

This is NOT your salary - that's in the time cost. Profit is what grows your business.

Add 20-30% on top of everything else.

## The Full Calculation

Let's price a silk press:

| Component | Amount |
|-----------|--------|
| Time (3 hrs × $40) | $120 |
| Products | $15 |
| Overhead | $25 |
| Subtotal | $160 |
| Profit (25%) | $40 |
| **Total** | **$200** |

If you're charging $80 for a silk press, you're literally paying to do people's hair.

# Module 2: "But My Clients Won't Pay That"

I hear this all the time. Here's the truth:

**Your current clients might not. But your IDEAL clients will.**

When I raised my prices, yes, I lost some clients. But here's what happened:
- I had fewer clients but made more money
- I wasn't exhausted anymore
- I attracted clients who valued my work
- My work actually got better because I wasn't burned out

The clients who leave when you raise prices? They were never your people. Let them go find the $50 braider and sit in her chair for 12 hours.

# Module 3: How to Raise Your Prices

## For New Clients
Start charging your new prices immediately. No explanation needed.

## For Existing Clients

1. Give 30-60 days notice
2. Explain the value (new training, better products, improved experience)
3. Don't apologize or over-explain
4. Offer a "loyalty transition" if needed (smaller increase for long-term clients)

Script: "Hey [name]! I wanted to let you know that starting [date], my prices will be updating. My new rate for [service] will be [price]. This reflects my continued investment in training and the quality products I use. I'd love to continue doing your hair!"

That's it. Don't write a novel. Don't apologize.

# Key Takeaways

1. Use the formula: Time + Products + Overhead + Profit
2. Know your numbers - track everything
3. Your prices reflect your value - believe it
4. The right clients will pay; the wrong ones will leave
5. Raise prices at least once a year

# Common Questions

**Q: What if I'm just starting out?**
A: You still need to cover your costs. Start at a sustainable rate, not a "building clientele" rate that has you broke. You can always offer a new client special, but your base prices should make sense.

**Q: How often should I raise prices?**
A: At minimum, once a year. But if you're booked 4+ weeks out consistently, that's a sign you should raise them now.

**Q: What if everyone in my area charges less?**
A: Good. That's your opportunity to stand out. Position yourself as premium. There are always clients willing to pay more for better service.
