  - question: "How do I know my hair porosity?"
    category: "hair_education"
    answer: |
      Great question - porosity is honestly more important than your curl pattern when it comes to choosing products.
      
      Here's the quick test I recommend:
      
      **The Float Test:**
      1. Take a few CLEAN strands (no product on them)
      2. Drop them in a glass of room temperature water
      3. Wait 2-4 minutes
      
      **Results:**
      - Floats at top = Low porosity (cuticles are tight, doesn't absorb easily)
      - Sinks to middle = Medium porosity (you're in the sweet spot!)
      - Sinks to bottom = High porosity (absorbs quick, loses moisture fast)
      
      **What it means for your routine:**
      - Low porosity: Use lightweight products, apply to warm/damp hair, LCO method works best
      - High porosity: Use heavier creams and butters, LOC method, focus on sealing
      
      Once you know your porosity, product selection gets SO much easier.

  - question: "Why does my hair feel dry even though I moisturize?"
    category: "hair_education"
    answer: |
      This is probably the #1 question I get, and there are a few common reasons:
      
      **1. You're not sealing the moisture**
      Water and leave-in = hydration. But if you don't seal with an oil or butter, that moisture evaporates. Always finish with a sealant.
      
      **2. You have high porosity hair**
      High porosity hair absorbs moisture fast but loses it just as fast. You need heavier products and need to focus on sealing.
      
      **3. Product buildup**
      If products are sitting ON your hair instead of absorbing, you might have buildup blocking moisture. When's the last time you clarified? Try a clarifying wash, then deep condition.
      
      **4. You need protein, not moisture**
      If your hair feels mushy and weak, you might actually have moisture overload. The fix is a protein treatment, not more moisture.
      
      **Quick fix:**
      - Clarify
      - Deep condition with heat for 20-30 mins
      - Apply leave-in to soaking wet hair
      - Seal with oil appropriate for your porosity
      
      That usually does the trick!

  - question: "How do I get more clients?"
    category: "business_mentorship"
    answer: |
      Okay, let's figure out what's actually going on. "I need more clients" usually means one of these:
      
      **1. You're just starting out**
      - Start with who you know (friends, family, coworkers - at a discounted rate, NOT free)
      - Post consistently on social media with local hashtags
      - Ask every happy client for a referral
      - Make it EASY to book you
      
      **2. You have clients but not enough**
      - Focus on rebooking before they leave the chair
      - Start a referral program ($20 off for them AND the new client)
      - Get on Google Business Profile for local search
      - Check your social media - are you posting your work?
      
      **3. You're busy but not with the RIGHT clients**
      - That's a different problem - we need to talk about raising prices and positioning
      
      The real talk: Building clientele takes 6-12 months of consistent effort. If you're expecting to be fully booked in month 2, adjust your expectations.
      
      What's your current situation? How long have you been at it?

  - question: "How much should I charge for [service]?"
    category: "business_mentorship"
    answer: |
      I can't give you a number without knowing YOUR costs, but I can give you the formula:
      
      **Service Price = Time + Products + Overhead + Profit**
      
      Here's how to calculate:
      
      **Time:** How many hours × your hourly rate
      (Hourly rate = desired annual income ÷ 50 weeks ÷ working hours per week)
      
      **Products:** What you actually use for that service
      
      **Overhead:** Monthly expenses ÷ services per month
      (Include rent, utilities, insurance, tools, marketing, etc.)
      
      **Profit:** Add 20-30% on top
      
      **Example - 3 hour service:**
      - Time: 3 hrs × $40/hr = $120
      - Products: $15
      - Overhead: $25
      - Subtotal: $160
      - Profit (25%): $40
      - **Total: $200**
      
      If that seems high compared to what you charge now... that's the problem. Most stylists are undercharging because they don't know their real costs.
      
      Do the math for YOUR situation. The number doesn't lie.
